As mentioned in the [previous article](/blog/hello-github-pages/) I used to run a blog back in the day. I used to write about rather random technical topics that would pop up. It was very opinionated. Mostly since I was quite influenced by [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz) who was my first serious introduction to the rabbit hole of Linux. I also quite liked [HexDSL](https://hexdsl.com) who introduced me to gemini and that's how the bi-hosted site was born. The articles weren't many. Their quality was questionable. Their practical impact close to none. It was just my opinions smushed together. I quite enjoyer writing it however.

I was cleaning up my file system and found the archived folder with the posts from that old website. I read through all of them and decided I should start again. Little different this time. Perhaps with a more pragmatic and less elitist approach. I decied however that I want to have my old gemini posts here as well.
