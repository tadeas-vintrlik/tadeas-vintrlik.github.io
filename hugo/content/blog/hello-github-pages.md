I have kept a blog in the past. It was rather quirky. Half of the time it was available as html half as Gemini on [vintrlik.org](https://vintrlik.org), which is no longer running.

I basically hacked together my own static site generator. With a few lines of shell script and awk. It was not the pretiest thing ever but it did the job.

I have since gone through quite a bit. Recently I stumbled upon my old archived blog posts. Although I do not quite agree with everything I wrote back then it was a blast to read.

I decided I should get back at it.
I will probably eventually upload the original blog posts to archive them here as well and for giggles mainly.

Although GitHub pages recommends Jekyll this site was made with the help of [hugo](https://gohugo.io).
