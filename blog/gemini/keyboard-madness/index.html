At first I was amazed since this was the first mechanical keyboard I ever got. It bought blue switches since I had primarily for writing, mostly code so it seemed like the ideal choice.\nThe keyboard was obviously very noisy (due to the blue switches) which annoyed people around me no end. I didn’t really mind it as I was using headphones a great deal of time. However after being stuck home due to the pandemic I grew tired of wearing headphones all the time and took them off every moment possible. This of course meant that I got to experience the keyboard noise in all it’s glory and Boy, was it loud.\nNew Keyboard? I had been on the lookout for ergonomic keyboard for quite some time and this seemed like the perfect moment to get one. I was in particular interested in split keyboards. If you don’t know what those are, essentially it is a keyboard split in to halves which can be positioned for better angle of your arms since putting them together on one keyboard can feel quite cramped and cause various issues with your wrists. Arguably the most famous ones are Ergodox keyboards and I was looking into them.\nThe Forbidden Fruit I was doing some work on a few projects which I needed to be strictly POSIX compliant. I decided to develop them on a platform which was much stricter out of the box than GNU is. Two options presented themselves. A FreeBSD box which was running on an old desktop of mine which I basically use as a file server. Or the family shared Mac Pro. As I never worked with Mac OS before and enjoy trying new things I decided to give the Mac a go.\nNow I won’t comment how development is on Mac OS I didn’t try quite enough things, but it has shell, vim, Emacs and clang so all is good in my books. But surprisingly enough what stood out to me the most (after the screen quality) was the keyboard. Some people despise it, some people swear by it and I became of the second kind. The small wireless low profile Apple Magic Keyboard.\nNow the keyboard was all fine and dandy on Mac OS it was not quite so well suited for other systems. The lack of some keys (Delete, Page Up and Down, Home and that entire area missing) proved to be quite troubling. Now there are ways to work around that I didn’t find it good enough also I hadn’t given up on the idea of a split keyboard quite yet.\nA Difficult Customer So now I had two main criteria for purchase: A split keyboard and as if that already wasn’t difficult enough chiclet on top of that. After a tough search I managed to find one that was not custom build and it even was in stock locally! What a catch! The name of this beauty is R-go split. As the name would suggest it is a split keyboard, however it has magnets on the inside and you can also use it as a regular keyboard should you want that. It also happens to be very portable which is sure to come in handy when I can finally go places. Neat!\nAll Set For Typing, Right? Well, yes and no. The hardware is on point now. But what about how the keyboard types. Specifically the layout? I am going to assume that you are using QWERTY, QWERTZ or AZERTY. These were designed back in the day when mechanical typewriters were used. The layout was chosen so that common letter pairs are far from one another to avoid key jamming (if you press two in rapid succession the keys would jam and you have to unstuck them manually). This is obviously not the case anymore and as it turns out it is not the optimal layout for modern computers. Alternative layouts were created to address this issue most famously the Dvorak layout.\nLearning Dvorak Now if you are into alternate keyboard layouts you might ask why Dvorak in particular? Aren’t there better layouts these days, right? Surely Dvorak had been obsoleted? I mean there is Colemak, Workman and others, why Dvorak? That is a good question. I chose Dvorak precisely because it is the oldest. It has the most support and it will be available wherever I need. There are also variants that have native support for some accent characters which I need from time to time. And despite what some people think it is quite decent when it comes to languages other than English.\nThe basic idea behind Dvorak is to alternate hand as much as possible hence why the vowels are concentrated on the side where left hand touch types and consonants on the right. This works fairly well even in other languages. Where Dvorak shines in particular is the home row. A good selection of English words are located entirely on the home row thus minimising finger movement.\nWill Another Layout Make Me A Better Typist? Highly unlikely, in fact a lot of people get about the same speed and precision on Dvorak as QWERTY or any other layout for that matter. Why bother then? One place where I saw a massive improvement was typing comfort and ergonomics which is what I am focusing on now the most. Unless you spend a significant time of your day typing, whether that be programming, writing books or articles it won’t likely be worth learning. I however fall into this category and decided to give it a go since I had a period of almost two months where I won’t be typing almost at all.\nThe Learning Process Learning a new layout was a pain. No sugar coating it. I was not a particularly fast typist on QWERTY but we learned touch typing in school and it stuck with me. Dvorak has only two letters in same positions and those are a and m. That’s it. Everything else is moved somewhere. The two main resources I used for learning was:\n=\u003e https://learn.dvorak.nl link\nand GNU Typist or gtypist. I think it is better to start learning words as fast as possible since hitting individual letters is very unrealistic and can lead to weird habits. After about a week of daily practice I knew the entire layout. Or at least in theory. Muscle memory is something entirely different. I decided to go head first and switch to it as my primary layout after about 10 days.\nThe Leap of Faith It was painful. This is how typing must feel for people who don’t use the computer regularly. Maybe it was even worse since they don’t know any better. It had an interesting upside, however. I argued with people less. Since the act of typing out just about anything was stressful enough arguing on top of it was just plain hell. Also you didn’t have the advantage of spamming you opponent with evidence due to the poor speed. I think I partially reattained it even now since I saw how useless even destructive it was to argue like this. Or maybe I’m just being to optimistic about it. You chose.\nThe Now Fast forward to now. I have been using Dvorak for about six weeks and about a month as my only layout. How is it? Pretty good actually but here are few things you might want to keep in mind.\nWhat I Learned First thing is. Unless you practice QWERTY the muscle memory will go away. Quite quickly at that. I’m barely able to type it now after only a month and mostly use hunt and peck when I absolutely have to. It is not nearly frequently enough for me to bother with practising both.\nSecond thing. Shortcuts. They were made with QWERTY in mind. Copy, paste and so on. I heard that Mac OS has a layout which is Dvorak but switches to QWERTY the moment you press the command key so that Ctrl V stays in the same location as it is on QWERTY. There is nothing like for GNU/Linux as far as I know. But I would not use it anyway, the shortcuts are fine in my opinion. Not as easy to do with one hand, but doable for the most part.\nThird. Vim. Oh is Vim a pain in Dvorak. Some people rebind every key so that it stays the same as in QWERTY. This seems a little excessive to me as the bindings are decent enough in Dvorak. Most people who use both (which is a really small group) seem to use it as is. Emacs bindings are actually alright, sometimes even better since it was made for easy memorisation not best ergonomics. The only thing that feels a little weird are A-x and C-x. I actually use the default Emacs keybindings now (I just rebound Caps Lock to Control and it’s good). There is also Dvorak layout for Ergomacs should you want that. It’s really good.\nEDIT: As of 3rd of September I am now fully back to vim. It took a little while to learn with Dvorak but it was much worth it.\nConclusion Was it worth it? For me it was and I’m glad I did it now rather than later. The typing comfort truly is considerably better. I am slowly getting to where my typing speed in QWERTY was. I think I might actually surpass it eventually since I did not practise and try to improve QWERTY. The transition made me more aware of typing in general.\nHave a great day and keep computing fun.\n",

Quite quickly at that. I&rsquo;m barely able to type it now after only a month and
mostly use hunt and peck when I absolutely have to. It is not nearly frequently
enough for me to bother with practising both.</p>
<p>Second thing. Shortcuts. They were made with QWERTY in mind. Copy, paste and so
on. I heard that Mac OS has a layout which is Dvorak but switches to QWERTY the
moment you press the command key so that Ctrl V stays in the same location as
it is on QWERTY. There is nothing like for GNU/Linux as far as I know. But I
would not use it anyway, the shortcuts are fine in my opinion. Not as easy to
do with one hand, but doable for the most part.</p>
<p>Third. Vim. Oh is Vim a pain in Dvorak. Some people rebind every key so that it
stays the same as in QWERTY. This seems a little excessive to me as the
bindings are decent enough in Dvorak. Most people who use both (which is a
really small group) seem to use it as is. Emacs bindings are actually alright,
sometimes even better since it was made for easy memorisation not best
ergonomics. The only thing that feels a little weird are A-x and C-x.
I actually use the default Emacs keybindings now (I just rebound Caps Lock to
Control and it&rsquo;s good). There is also Dvorak layout for Ergomacs should you
want that. It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>EDIT: As of 3rd of September I am now fully back to vim. It took a little while
to learn with Dvorak but it was much worth it.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h3>
<p>Was it worth it? For me it was and I&rsquo;m glad I did it now rather than later. The
typing comfort truly is considerably better. I am slowly getting to where my
typing speed in QWERTY was. I think I might actually surpass it eventually
since I did not practise and try to improve QWERTY. The transition made me more
aware of typing in general.</p>
