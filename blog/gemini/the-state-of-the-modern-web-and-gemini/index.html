As stated my first ever post.\nThis goes only into technical advantages of such an approach, but of course there are more things to consider here.\nHave you ever been searching for a quick answer to your question only to open a random site and mindlessly agree to their cookies policy? Let’s face it, who has not. I myself try to pay at least some attention to it and click off things I can. However the way these things are designed is to make it as hard as can be. Just the other day I stumbled across one where I had to manually tick off around a few dozen companies if I did not want my cookies shared with them of course including the major ‘villains’ - Facebook, Google and Amazon.\nIt is becoming ever increasingly difficult to browse the Web without being constantly tracked at every step. Sites being larger than entire programmes I use Loading CSS and JavaScript from questionable third-party sites and much more.\nWhere Gemini Comes in The last two weeks it seems that almost every Linux video creator seems to have talked about it to some extent. But in case you are still unsure here’s a summary:\nIt’s a simple protocol for transfer of files mostly centred around small inter-linked text files. It tries to be the middle-ground between Gopher and the Modern Web. If you don’t know anything about Gopher do not worry Gemini is much closer to it than the Web so as I will explain Gemini in more detail I’m sure you will understand.\nWhat Is it For? If you want more information you can find the on the project’s official site (both on HTTP and gemini)\nIt can handle very simple text sites (called capsules) that can do some basic text formatting based no Markdown. Three levels of headers, bullet point lists, quotes and formatted block (code-blocks). It can also link to other files and that is all. Wait that is it? No images, no tables, nothing? Indeed. It was designed with very deep minimalism in mind and so that both clients and servers are very simple pieces of software capable of being written over the weekend by one person.\nBut as you can see it is just perfect for a site like mine. Just lightly formatted text and not much besides that. If you want to you can put links to images on there which will be opened in your default image viewer, so this way it is much UNIXier than modern browser which essentially act like document readers, image viewers, video players and so on. Now for video while technically being possible to be downloaded via Gemini it will likely not be a pleasant experience since it does not support any form of caching and so if your connection is slow and especially unstable it will not work very well.\nIt is also possible to do some scripting. But it only supports server side scripting. So nothing runs in your browser, only on the server side. This means no cookies, no fingerprinting and so on.\nThis however poses certain limitations such as no Shopping carts, no… (I tried really hard but could no come up with any other good reasons). So it will never become a true replacement for the Web and neither does it try to! It’s just a way for people who want to share simple but important information in more reasonable ways.\nLast but definitely not least the protocol enforces TLS on all requests, so it quite secure and will stay this way since it does not leave much space for future changes. This is of course a double-edged weapon since it means that there is not way to address it’s shortcomings but also it will stay the way it is and will not simply become just as bad as the Web is.\nHow Can I Get on the Gemini-space? OK so you are sold on the idea of Gemini and want to give it a go. How can you do that. You’ll need a special client to do that. A list of them can be found on the Gemini project site.\nThere are some graphical ones and some terminal ones to suit everyone’s needs. I can personally recommend Amfora for the terminal and Lagrange for the GUI. You can also ssh into the gemini server and try the terminal ones there if you do not want to install them yourself.\nBut what now? How do I find things? There are a few gemini search engines most notably geminispace\nIt can search among added capsules and there is also a list of all known capsules. So you can browse to your heart’s content.\nCan I Host My Own Capsule? Sure you can and it is quite easy to do! The only thing you need is a gemini server. There are a couple you can search one you like but let me give you a few recommendations. Agate is a really simple one to set-up and I see most people using it. It has a really nice GitHub README telling you everything you need to get it running in a few minutes. Gemini servers require very little resources unlike their HTTP counterparts so you can comfortably run it from a Raspberry Pi for example. Of course if you want other’s to visit your capsule you need a public IP address.\nMy Personal Thoughts It is quite refreshing seeing such a project get popular in the current year and I am quite hopeful of it’s future. Now I do not expect non tech-savvy people to start ever using but it’s good knowing something like this is out there for people who want to use it.\nIt reminds a bit of the older days of the web (not that I am that old). But still even a decade back it was a completely different place and every site you opened could be a potential hidden gem. People were hanging out on multiple sites and the web was a lot less centralised. It can be quite fun just stumbling upon someone’s personal site randomly.\nYou might have noticed that in this article I put each of the links on their separate line and this is because this is the way Gemini does it. Since from now on I will be bi-hosting this as a HTTP website as well as a gemini capsule. (This link is now dead)\nHave a great day and keep computing fun.\n",
