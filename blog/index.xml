      <description>As mentioned in the previous article I used to run a blog back in the day. I used to write about rather random technical topics that would pop up. It was very opinionated. Mostly since I was quite influenced by Luke Smith who was my first serious introduction to the rabbit hole of Linux. I also quite liked HexDSL who introduced me to gemini and that&amp;rsquo;s how the bi-hosted site was born.</description>

      <description>I have kept a blog in the past. It was rather quirky. Half of the time it was available as html half as Gemini on vintrlik.org, which is no longer running.
I basically hacked together my own static site generator. With a few lines of shell script and awk. It was not the pretiest thing ever but it did the job.
I have since gone through quite a bit. Recently I stumbled upon my old archived blog posts.</description>
