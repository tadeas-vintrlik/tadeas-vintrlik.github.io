      <description>As I mentioned in my last article I have a FreeBSD box running FTP as a file server. I use for my personal media, source codes, scripts and share it like this between all my other computers. While this site is (as of yet) running on Debian I have considered FreeBSD to be much more pleasant on the server side of things.
I have however never run FreeBSD as a daily driver desktop and decided that it was time to give that a go.</description>

      <title>Keyboard Madness</title>

      <description>A year ago I got my first mechanical keyboard. It was a cheap one with no worthy brand name to back it up. At first I was amazed since this was the first mechanical keyboard I ever got. It bought blue switches since I had primarily for writing, mostly code so it seemed like the ideal choice.
The keyboard was obviously very noisy (due to the blue switches) which annoyed people around me no end.</description>

      <description>As you might have notice from just about anything on my website. I like to keeps things simple, maybe too simple. But it has a set of advantages. As stated my first ever post.
This goes only into technical advantages of such an approach, but of course there are more things to consider here.

      <description>If you spend any amount of time in the computer science or as I prefer to call it Hacker community (in the original meaning of the word) you likely have heard of this feud old as the culture itself. Emacs vs Vi editors and their descendants.
To make the terminology clear in the beginning from now if I use the term Emacs I specifically refer to the GNU implementation of the Emacs editor as this is the most widespread one today and the one I have most experience with.</description>

      <description>Today I had a bit of free time on my hands and I decided to revisit this crappy site of mine. After a few busy weeks in school where nothing happened on this site in the semi-broken state I left it was asking for a change.
The reason for changing the site, however goes much deeper as I yet again jumped the boat from Emacs to Vim. The reason for that will require a post of its own.</description>
