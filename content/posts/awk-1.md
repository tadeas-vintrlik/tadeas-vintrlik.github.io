title: 'Why should I learn awk?'
---

This is a first article in my series on the awk language. I had decided to write this because I feel the language is quite unkown or underrated considering it's usefulnes. In my opinion it is one of the best things to come out of *UNIX* and is essentialy omnipresent and yet underutilised. It is essentisentially a very advanced text filter (like *grep* or *sed*) and therefore integrates perfectly with the usual *UNIX* workflow. I personally believe the lack of knowledge of *awk* is why people say that *bash* scripting is not good for data processing. While for more advanced tasks *Python*, *R* or other are certainly a better choice; for simple, especially ad-hoc data processing *awk* is invaluable.

Did I get your attention? Ready to learn you some *awk*? Good, let's get started.
