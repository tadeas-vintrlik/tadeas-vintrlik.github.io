      <description>I have kept a blog in the past. It was rather quirky. Half of the time it was available as html half as Gemini on vintrlik.org, which is no longer running.
I basically hacked together my own static site generator. With a few lines of shell script and awk. It was not the pretiest thing ever but it did the job.
I have since gone through quite a bit. Recently I stumbled upon my old archived blog posts.</description>
